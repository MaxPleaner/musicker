This is a static website generated by the [genrb](http://github.com/maxpleaner/gen.rb).

Basically it's written in slim, coffeescript, and sass in the `source/` folder and compiled to `dist/`.

The compilation can be triggered by running `ruby gen.rb` or will happen automatically upon file change if `guard` is run.

After generating the site (if cloning the repo, there's no need to do this), open `dist/index.html` in the browser.

This is a little web app for making music.

Major features:

- Record samples from microphone
- View a list of samples and trigger them.
- Multitrack playback with level control
